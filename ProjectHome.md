Ertf is a module that displays the content of an [rtf](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Text_Format) document  in an [evas](http://trac.enlightenment.org/e) object, an evas text block to be precise. The renderer is an evas smart object that uses an evas text block. Currently, it conforms to [RTF specification version 1.0](http://latex2rtf.sourceforge.net/RTF-Spec-1.0.txt). Support for images and tables is not available now. Only ANSI charset is supported now. It also includes basic text editing features.
